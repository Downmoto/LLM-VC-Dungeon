# Features Roadmap

## Planned Features (Next Few Weeks)

### Front End Terminal Commands with Positional Arguments
- implement a command parser for system-level commands with positional arguments
- support slash commands (e.g., `/help`, `/save <slot>`, `/load <slot>`, `/theme <name>`)
- provide feedback for invalid command syntax
- keep natural language input for in-game actions (handled by llm tool calling)

### New Game with User Defined Theme
- add theme selection interface at game start
- allow users to specify genre/setting (fantasy, sci-fi, horror, etc.)
- pass theme context to llm for consistent narrative generation

### Enhanced Tool Calling
- improve llm tool calling reliability for low-level local models
- implement structured output validation and correction
- add retry logic with schema enforcement
- provide clearer tool definitions and examples

### Enhanced/Refactored Game Generation
- refactor game generation to separate programmatic logic from narrative creation
- offload procedural generation (room layouts, connections, basic stats) to code
- limit llm responsibility to narrative descriptions and storytelling
- reduce token usage and improve generation speed

### Voice Model Integration
- integrate text-to-speech for game narration
- (low priority - may fall out of scope depending on time constraints)
